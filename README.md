# expresslike

An express like java http server using `com.sun.net.httpserver`

This is a much cleaner version of my [java refresher project](https://github.com/johnreybacal/vanilla-java-api) which is a java version of [vanilla-node-api](https://github.com/johnreybacal/vanilla-node-api)

and it has more features such as:
- Multiple middlewares
- Next middleware control
